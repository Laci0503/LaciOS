# LaciOS
A hand crafted OS <br/>
Not in runnable state right now, <br/>
I will cahnge the description if there is a runable branch. <br/>
I was runable before, but I'm changing the whole architecture right now, <br/>
and upload the new runable one into branch main. <br/>
There is a working and runnable branch in indev_laci0503. You can try it, but it doesn't do much just yet.
